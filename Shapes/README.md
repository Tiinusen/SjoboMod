# Shapes
These are 2D Shapes created in PostED, it's an easy way of building room layouts and modify them without having to deal with the 3D view.

I would have recommended saving Brushes as the go to method, but since that feature is broken in PostED this is the only way of archive any form of efficiency.

## Filenames
I choose to name the files like this so you know what the shape lookslike and on what AXIS it should be extruded on "Extruded Shape" and the length.
