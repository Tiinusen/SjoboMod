# Source Code
This folder contains all classes, and by looking on other class folders
in the Postal 2 Editor folder I realize it does not support subfolders.

## Getting started
An easy way to get started is by figuring out what parent class matches the
closest to what you want to do, then you make your own class and extend it.

Modify the original logic by overriding functions or add your completely own.

To provide some aid in this I've created VSCode snippets that are ready to use.

**Known snippet prefixes are**:
* comment
* section-comment
* event
* state
* function
* controller

The biggest advice I can give you is to listen to the compiler and look
through the original source code for inspiration, since half of this job
is to reverse engineer what they did and do it in our own way.
